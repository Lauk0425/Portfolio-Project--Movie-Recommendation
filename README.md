# Portfolio-Project--Movie-Recommendation
Portfolio Project utilizing Python Pandas, NumPy, Sklearn, Ipywidgets

Movie nights often involve endless scrolling through streaming apps like Netflix and Hulu, leaving you exhausted and indecisive. To solve this, I built a movie recommendation system in Python that uses libraries like Pandas and sklearn. It analyzes a massive dataset of over 60,000 movies and user ratings to provide you with 10 similar movies based on your search. Simply type in a movie title, and my system suggests excellent options, eliminating decision fatigue and ensuring a fantastic movie night. Think of it as your personal movie oracle, always ready to guide you to your next cinematic adventure.
